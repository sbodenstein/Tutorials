It can even be used for supervised learning problems. For example, training a neural net to optimize a non-differentiable objective (such as accuracy, or the [BLEU score in machine translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144)) or [finding a good neural net architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578) for a particular supervised learning problem.\n",

If the episode took $T$ steps, and got a reward $r_t$ at each step, then this return is $R = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r_{t}$, where $r_t$ is the reward received at timestep $t$.\n",

This is called the [Markov Property](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~10601b/slides/MDP_RL.pdf). Most real-world environments are not like this. Consider the problem of using a reinforcement learning agent to control a self-driving car, where an observation is a frame from its onboard video cameras. List various ways in which the Markov Property is violated in this environment (this is also known as a *partially-observed environment*). How might you modify the architecture of your policy net to operate in a non-Markovian environment like this?"
